                <blockquote>
                    <p>I was born and raised in Detroit, MI. My lovely mother birthed three beautiful children. I'm the oldest and love my beautiful sister and handsome brother. I loved growing up in Detroit. I enjoyed our family gatherings, the family reunions, and all the parties. The camaraderie of the neighborhood was inspirational because we knew every other kid on the block. The city Detroit is all about people working hard in a blue-collar community. The saying is "Detroit is built Ford tough" is true. My family and city made me who I am today. I love my family very, very much. I lived in several cities and states. I truly enjoyed my time in Miami, Florida, Brooklyn, NY. and presently here in the garden state of New Jersey. I love all my sports teams but none more so greater than the Detroit Lions. I'm a huge Detroit Lions football fan. Pleased to be part of a flag football team. As of today, I'm currently enrolled as a graduate student at New Jersey Institute of Technology. I plan on working in the field of cybersecurity and later in the private sector.</p>
